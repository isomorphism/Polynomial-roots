This program generates images related to roots of polynomials.

There are two main routines:

- Roots.
This plots roots of polynomials. Given a particular viewing region R in the complex plane,
a set of coefficients A and a degree d, this plots all roots of polynomials of degree up to d,
with coefficients in A, within the region R.

- IFS.
This plots the corresponding iterated function systems, and tries to predict the scale factors
to make it look like the corresponding plot of roots.


The program can parse options at runtime, otherwise it takes in a config file,
such as the following (no blank line at the beginning):

roots                              Choice of routine (roots/ifs/both)
[-1,1]                             Set of coefficients
(400,400)                          Resolution (width,height)

0.672233 :+ (-0.0921782)           Center (this one produces feather-like patterns) 
0.00001                            Width 
warm 12                            Gradient (warm/cold/grey/binary, + possible parameter)
